			<p>This website was created by a single brilliant mind who sought solely to "educate" and "entertain" the masses.</p>
		
			<p>In all seriousness, with few ideas properly springing to mind, I resorted creating what I make best, something utterly stupid by nature, solely to entertain myself and whoever else is fortunate enough to find it funny.</p>
		
			<p>Most of the images of insects were provided by friends, and the graphics created in MS paint, rather hastily might I add, as the stress and anxiety of school work was more than enough to consume the past six weeks.</p>
			
			<p>Whatever, just laugh at the mediocre website full of insect PNGs and JPEGs, alright?</p>
